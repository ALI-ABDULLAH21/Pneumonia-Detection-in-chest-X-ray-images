# Chest X-ray Pneumonia Detection using CNN

## Overview
This Python script utilizes TensorFlow and Keras to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images. The model is trained and tested using the Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset obtained from Kaggle.

## Dependencies
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- PIL (Pillow)
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- Kaggle API (for dataset access)

## Dataset
The Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset is available on Kaggle. The dataset is divided into training, validation, and testing sets, each containing images labeled as 'NORMAL' or 'PNEUMONIA'.

## Usage
1. Download the Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset from Kaggle and structure it as follows:
   ```
   /kaggle/input/chest-xray-pneumonia/
       |-- chest_xray/
           |-- train/
           |-- val/
           |-- test/
   ```
2. Run the provided Python script in a Kaggle environment or any Python environment with the required dependencies installed.

## Code
```python
# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# ... (The rest of your code goes here)
```

## CNN Architecture
The CNN model consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. The model is designed for binary classification, predicting whether an input X-ray image indicates pneumonia or is normal.

```plaintext
Model Architecture:
- Conv2D(32, (3,3), activation='relu')
- MaxPooling2D(2,2)
- Conv2D(64, (3,3), activation='relu')
- MaxPooling2D(2,2)
- Conv2D(128, (3,3), activation='relu')
- MaxPooling2D(2,2)
- Conv2D(256, (3,3), activation='relu')
- MaxPooling2D(2,2)
- Conv2D(512, (3,3), activation='relu')
- MaxPooling2D(2,2)
- Flatten()
- Dense(256, activation='relu')
- Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
```

## Training and Evaluation
The model is trained using an Adam optimizer with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Training is performed on the training set with validation on the validation set.

```python
model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
history = model.fit_generator(data_train, epochs=2, validation_data=data_valid)
```

## Evaluation on Test Set
The model is evaluated on the test set to measure its performance.

```python
model.evaluate(data_test)
```

## Predictions
The trained model is used to make predictions on a subset of the test set. Random images are displayed along with their corresponding pneumonia probability.

```python
predictions = model.predict(data_test)
x = data_test.next()
for i in range(0, 1):
    image = x[i]
    for j in range(0, 16):
        plt.imshow(image[j])
        plt.show()
        print("Pneumonia Probability is: ", predictions[i])
```

Feel free to explore, modify, and enhance the script for further experimentation with pneumonia detection in chest X-ray images.
